- ARM architecture is commonly found in devices that prioritize lower power consumption and portability.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **After downloading the ZIP file, make sure to extract all files from the ZIP**. The Glow application is a portable software, so it doesnâ€™t require installation, but all files must be in the same folder for it to run correctly.

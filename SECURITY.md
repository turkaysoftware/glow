# 🛡️ Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously. To ensure the safety of our users, we focus our efforts on maintaining the most recent version of the software.

## 📦 Supported Versions

We only provide security updates and bug fixes for the **latest stable release**. We recommend all users upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible to stay protected.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes    |
| Older   | ❌ No     |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue.** Public disclosure before a fix is available puts all users at risk.

### 🛠️ How to Report
Please report vulnerabilities privately using the GitHub **"Report a vulnerability"** feature:
1. Navigate to the [Security](https://github.com/turkaysoftware/glow/security/advisories/new) tab of this repository.
2. Click on **"Advisories"** and then **"Report a vulnerability"**.

### ⚙️ Our Process
* **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
* **Fix & Disclosure:** We will work on a fix as a priority. Once a patch is released, we will publish a security advisory to inform the community, giving you full credit for the discovery.

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you follow responsible disclosure principles by giving us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before sharing any information publicly.

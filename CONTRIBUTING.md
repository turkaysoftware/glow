Please follow these guidelines to make the contribution process smooth for everyone.

1. Before creating a new issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.  
2. For bug fixes or new features, open an issue first to discuss the planned change.  
3. Fork the repository and create a feature branch named like:  
   - feature/my-feature  
   - fix/issue-123  
4. Make small, focused commits and provide a clear PR description that includes:  
   - What you changed  
   - Why you changed it  
   - How to test the change  
5. Run the build locally and include any test results or screenshots in the PR.  
6. Follow code style and formatting conventions for C#. Using an .editorconfig file or the default Visual Studio settings is recommended.  
7. Add unit tests for new features or bug fixes when possible.  
8. Maintain backward compatibility where possible and document any breaking changes in the PR.  
9. Be respectful and constructive in all communication.

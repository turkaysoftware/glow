2.  **Open an Issue First:** For significant bug fixes or new features, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes. This ensures that your efforts align with the project's roadmap.

## 🛠 Development Workflow
To maintain a clean and organized repository, we follow these steps:

2.  **Commit Standards:** Make small, focused commits with clear messages that describe "what" and "why".
3.  **Code Style (C#):**
    * Follow the project's `.editorconfig` rules or default Visual Studio formatting.
    * Maintain clean code principles and ensure consistent naming conventions.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance
